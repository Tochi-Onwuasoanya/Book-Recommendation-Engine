A search engine that recommends books to users using machine learning, cosine similarity, and collaborative filtering. Made with Python and Jupyter Lab.

# What you need
Packages/libraries/languages: <br></br>
Need to have pandas, numpy, python, sckit-learnâ€¦ installed on your computer in order to run project
Would recommend anaconda and anacoda navigator as well
IDE: 
Pycharm professional, Jupyter Lab, or any ide that supports python and .ipynb files

Data files:
You can download and view the necessary data from these links:
- Data overview - https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu...
- goodreads_books.json.gz - https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1LXpK1... 
- goodreads_interactions.csv - https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zmy...

# How to run  
- Download data files 
- Download zip file and unzip to folder of choice. 
- You can then open that folder in your ide, and then run within ide.
- You can also copy the files into an ide like pycharm, or jupyter lab, and run the project from there. 


*Highly recommend jupyter lab for this project*

When running the project, use the "search.ipynb" file to search for books and their book ids. 

Then create a "likedbooks.csv" file using this template:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZT_q6r64qzoqGQ1zoBHcb9oggk9Kv45VP1bdF9kKLnc/edit?usp=sharing

Put your own user id (any number is fine as long as it is the same in every row), the book id you got from "search.ipynb", your rating of the book on a scale of 1-5, and the book title

You can also download a sample liked books csv from:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dhPh.. (my personal liked books)

Then export and download that file as a csv 

To get recommendations:
- Head to the collaborative_filtering.ipynb file
- Then, run the entire project, starting from the first cell. 

If running in pycharm, wherever a file is read or imported in the code, replace that with the path to the files wherever you downloaded them.
If running in jupyter notebook/lab, then add the files directly to the workspace you're working in. 

Remember to modify the book id's, and search queries in order to make the recommendations personalized for you!!
You can use the search file to help search for book id's, or go on goodreads yourself to get them.

# Next steps
- Learn how to make program accesible on the terminal/command line, then update readme
- Create front-end in order for users to be able to use the program as a web application
- Try to find more similar users (only took the first 15)
- Decrease output time for recommendation results
